This repo contains the script run_analysis.R.

This script will create a tidy data set from the data files in the "UCI HAR Dataset" directories and sub-directories.

The script performs the following: 

# Read in the TEST & TRAIN subject data sets and combine them

# Read in the TEST & TRAIN activity data sets and combine them

# Read in the activity labels and merge them into the activity data set

# Read in the TEST & TRAIN results data sets and combine them (only the first 6 columns)

# Combine the subjects, activities, & results into one data set

# Add descriptive variable names

# Create tidy dataset

# Write out the tidy data set to "tidydata.txt"
